            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>The target audience are any individuals traveling from one city to another in Madagascar. There are three
                distinct groups:
            <ul>
                <li>Domestic travelers</li>
                <li>Business travelers</li>
                <li>Tourists.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h1>Personas</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Louise is a retired schoolteacher. She is highly respected in her extended family and they expect
                    her to attend every family reunion. Because her family is spread out in several cities, she often
                    has to take a bush taxi, and travel can sometimes take several days to part of the country with a
                    very different climate. She always wonders what clothes she should bring with her.
                    She doesn’t have a smartphone and is not computer savvy, so she relies on the teenagers living with
                    her.
                </li>
                <li>Mathias is French and is a resident in Madagascar. He owns a garage specialized in restoring vintage
                    cars. He often has to travel to other cities to buy his future projects, and he likes to go there
                    using his most recent creations. He needs to know how the roads are, because in Madagascar, the
                    roads can greatly change with the weather (mud slides, new potholes, …).
                    He uses both a smartphone and a computer to browse the internet.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h1>Scenarios</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Thomas is planning his itinerary for his vacation in Madagascar next year. He visits madaroad.mg and
                    finds their safety advice for travel very useful, especially the list of taboos to avoid for each
                    region he plans to visit.</li>
                <li>Marie received a call in the morning, a relative died in Diego Suarez and she has to be there for
                    the funerals. She knows a cyclone has passed over the North of Madagascar last week, so she is
                    wondering if the roads to Diego Suarez are passable or not. She goes on madaroad.mg to find out.
                </li>
                <li>Jeremiah is a tour operator in Madagascar. He has a group of tourists paying for his services next
                    week, so he visits madaroad.mg as usual to plan their trip.</li>
                <li>Tendry has a job interview in Antananarivo in 2 days, but he heard there was a cyclone incoming. He
                    goes on madaroad.mg because he knows they always have reliable information about incoming cyclones.
                </li>
                <li>Aëla is concerned about her mother who is from a remote village in the countryside and who took a
                    bush taxi 2 days ago to visit her. She should have arrived in the morning, but Aëla didn’t hear
                    anything from her, and her mother doesn’t have a phone. She visits madaroad.mg to see if there was
                    any problem on the road her mother took.</li>
