            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>The target audience are those that deal with snow in daily:
            <ul>
                <li>Snow Plowing Businesses</li>
                <li>Citizens</li>
                <li>First-Aid Responders</li>

            <h1>Personas</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Chandler is the head chief of the local fire department in Aspen, Colorado. He has saved countless of skiers from avalanches and 
                    has prevented many to ski when an avalanche warning is in place. 
                    He‚Äôs always checking the weather before, during and after his shift to make sure 
                    he is prepared for any occasion. His crew is his family and wants them to always be safe and prepared with the right tools to save a life.
                     He has never been too fond of the snow and would prefer a hot day over snow any day. 
                    As the years has gone by, he wonders if he will ever be ready for a real snow day. 
                </li>
                <li>Sabino absolutely loves the snow more than anything. He loves to wear a t-shirt and shorts even in the coldest of days. 
                    He gets excited knowing that snow is still outside on the ground.  
                    His car is an old Impala that takes ages to start up due to the raging cold seasons, but work is important to make ends meet for his family of 5. 
                    Lately, he has been having to get to work late because he doesn‚Äôt know if it will snow tomorrow or not. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h1>Scenarios</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>A skiing resort owner, <strong>Ali</strong>, is anxious to see some snow fall this season, but has not seen any. He wants something to notify him and his customers when snow is on
                    the ground so that he can open the skiing lifts to the public. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Xayelyh</strong> has to work 1 mile to college every morning. She isn't a big fan of the snow and sometimes can forget to wear extra layers to make sure she doesn't get
                    hypothermia in her journey to and from college. Her friend recommended to check out isitsnowing.com to find out how to prepare in the morning according to the climate.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Jorge</strong> owns a small plowing business that consists of him and his two sons. They manage the lots of all of the local LDS churches and make sure they
                    are clean and salted every morning before 11AM. He has noticed that his sons get alerts about snow a day before and sees them set alarms. He wants to be
                    prepared like them and he does so by going to isitsnowing.com for vital information.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Abraham</strong> is an avid skier. Never misses a season to go and skii! Last season, his biggest fear of avalanches covering him came through and almost lost his life. 
                    He feels that it is safer to know beforehand if there's an avalance warning. With the daily visit to isitsnowing.com, he feels confident to enjoy the snow while skiing without
                    his fear becoming a reality again. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Alex</strong> is from California. He hates the snow, but loves to visit his grandma in Alaska every summer. Every time he goes over, he realizes that he never packs enough
                    winter clothes to handle the cold. This time, he wants to make sure he does by calling his grandma and setting up his email to receive notifications from isitsnowing.com. 
                    This will be his first time trying the site and will make sure to pay attention to it for any significant warnings.
